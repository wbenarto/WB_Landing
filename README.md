# Hello friends! Welcome to Webe Sushi! 
Webe Sushi is a fun project combining two different skills I have cultivated over the years: Sushi Chef and Web Developer.

Webe sushi is a Full-stack web application to learn how to create Omakase style sushi at home! I had tons of fun building this project. Please let me know if you have any constructive feedback for my web-app. Enjoy! 

All sushi made by William Benarto, pictures taken by Jin Choi, logo Nav bar designed by Alfian Laurens.
